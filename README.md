# Momentum Strategy and Portfolio Optimisation Report

This repository contains an in-depth analysis and report on a momentum-based trading strategy, applied to select NASDAQ assets from 2014 to 2024. The project covers the implementation, backtesting, optimisation, and performance evaluation of a momentum trading strategy, as well as portfolio optimisation techniques.

## 📖 Introduction
The report begins with an analysis of the adjusted closing prices of ten NASDAQ assets (e.g., EBAY, SBUX, NFLX) over a 10-year period, assessing trends and overall performance. Notable stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) are identified for their strong performance, which lays the foundation for implementing and testing a momentum strategy.

## 📈 Momentum Strategy
The momentum trading strategy is based on the Simple Moving Average (SMA) technique. The strategy generates buy and sell signals based on SMA crossovers, with NFLX selected as a case study asset for this strategy.

## 🔄 Backtesting
Backtesting was performed on NFLX from 2014-2024 to demonstrate the performance of the momentum strategy. The backtest results include analysis of peak and trough points based on the buy/sell signals generated by the strategy.

## ⚙️ Strategy Optimisation
This section evaluates the risk-adjusted return of different configurations of the momentum strategy, using the Sharpe ratio to compare various short-term and long-term moving average combinations.

## 📊 Comparison Between Shares
The report provides a comparison of selected NASDAQ stocks' performance, specifically analysing recovery trends in assets like NFLX and SBUX during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 🧮 Portfolio Optimisation
Portfolio optimisation is performed using Python's Riskfolio-Lib package, with the objective of constructing a mean-variance optimised portfolio. The analysis includes:
- Efficient frontier visualisation
- Optimal portfolio composition
- Risk measures for diversification and risk management
